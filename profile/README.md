# Who are we?

Zdravo! We are the team of the mountains, rivers and fields. We come from a history and culture-rich land with creatures and castles. Delicious dishes surround us, from the seas and caves to the forests and plains. As the old saying goes: The most beautiful city lies in the heart of the chicken. Amongst the greenest cities of Europe hides Ljubljana, the capital guarded by dragons. As we go to school we wish the castle a good morning, leave footsteps on the bridges and a mark on the old town, the same way we wish to shape the future.

Tomorrow is up to us, future engineers to solve. Lesson by lesson, project by project the seeds of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics blossom into something that will make the future great. By giving knowledge we learn. And thus all fields narrow down to one magnificent narrative, robotics. This is where we create, grow and smile through the process. Every robot has a special place in our tale, that is passed on from one generation to another.

Our passionate team is truly excited to present what a talented squad from a small nation is capable of. Alongside former members that now mentor our path we canâ€™t wait to show what we have to offer in the engineering world of problem solving. We are FIRST Slovenia.
